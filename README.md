# Overview
This is a React boilerplate focused on enabling high developer velocity while implementing idiomatic Redux Hooks and React Hooks.

## Overview Video
Here's a video that walks through some of the major features of this boilerplate.

Coming soon. Have to update based on refactoring to use [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)

# Installation and Running

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

- Runs the app in the development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
- The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
- Prettier will run and auto-format your code whenever a file is saved.
- You will also see any lint errors in the console.
  - *Currently lint errors get written out twice. We will try and fix this soon.*

### `npm test`

- Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

---
**NOTE**

Note that you must place `node-module` mocks in the `webapp/src/__mocks__` director because `create-react-app` reset Jest's `roots` config for performance reasons. I lost half a day on figuring this out so figured I'd share. The PR is below.

---

### `npm run build`

- Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
- The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
- Your app is ready to be deployed!
- See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Configuration
Below are configurations supported in this boilerplate.

## API Proxy
coming soon...

# Learn More
